Updating an installed Linux CRUX system on the fly is possible in local or
remote mode.

	# sh /boot/CRUX-3.5-live.run
	Use /mnt as the root of the temporary system? [Y/n]
	Switch to temporary system in /mnt? [Y/n]
	{starting minimal system}

Login as user from console or over ssh and become superuser (su).
Update packages manually or with pkguse (pkguse -sr /mnt).

	# setup_chroot
	# rejmerge
	# reboot

Enjoy :)
