NOTE:

To add the kernel firmware, create a file called "firmware" with a list of
required files (one per line).

To build a kernel for a machine named HOSTNAME, create the initial
configuration HOSTNAME.config and a list of firmware files HOSTNAME.firmware
in the /usr/ports/CRUX directory.
The self-extracting archive CRUX-$version-HOSTNAME-kernel.run will be created
in the $PKGMK_PACKAGE_DIR directory.
